# Repository contents:

## 1. README file (this one)
Gives an overview of the repository contents and purpose

## 2. Code Book
Explains the variables, summary calculations, and any transformations used in the code (run_analysis.R)

## 3. run_analysis.R
Code used to import, process/clean, analyze/summarize, and export the data. The purpose of this code is to produce a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. 

### The code follows 5 steps: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set; 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names; 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 

the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
